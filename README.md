3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your Spotify API credentials:

   ```env
   CLIENT_ID="your_spotify_client_id"
   CLIENT_SECRET="your_spotify_client_secret"
   ```

   Replace `your_spotify_client_id` and `your_spotify_client_secret` with your actual Spotify API credentials.

## Usage

4. The script will start downloading the songs in MP3 format to the `music` directory, & create a directory using the playlist name.

## Notes

- Spoti-Tube uses the [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) library to interact with YouTube and download videos.

- The downloaded songs will be saved in the `music` directory with the playlist name as a subdirectory.

- If an error occurs during the download, the script will continue with the next song.
